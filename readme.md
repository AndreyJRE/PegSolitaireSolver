# Puzzle-Solving Application

This project is a Java-based puzzle-solving application that implements three different search algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search. The goal of the puzzle is to rearrange pieces on a 5x5 board to reach a solved state. The board contains three types of pieces: 'W', 'B', and 'o', representing white pieces, black pieces, and an empty space, respectively.


## Usage

1. Run the `Game` class.
2. Enter the desired algorithm (`bfs`, `dfs`, or `a*`) when prompted.
3. The program will output the steps to reach the solution or indicate if no solution is found.
4. The execution time and the number of nodes expanded are also displayed.
